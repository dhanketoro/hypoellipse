Example of the use of ttgen.

model.def is the input file for ttgen that specifies
the velocity versus depth model.

ttab is the travel-time table generated by ttgen that
can be used with HYPOELLIPSE.

ttab000 - ttab198 are designed for making plots of 
travel time versus distance for each depth in the
travel-time table.
