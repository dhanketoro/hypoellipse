Hypoellipse Running for ElementaryOS (Ubuntu Based)

This script is originally from John Lahr's and Fred Klein
I edited some of '.f' files so the code can compiled and run in Linux.

This directory contains :
- source and executable files for HYPOELLIPSE
- examples of datasets for program runs
- files for creating local travel-time tables for use with HYPOELLIPSE


To compile source files you can use command :

cd ./source
make

for compiling the Hypoellipse, and

cd ./ttgen
make

for compiling ttgen (travel times generator) code.
